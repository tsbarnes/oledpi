# oledpi

oledpi is a simple Python application that displays info on a Waveshare 2.23" OLED HAT.

The 2.23" OLED HAT is a Raspberry Pi-compatible display controlled by a SSD1305 chip.

This application is based on the sample code provided by Waveshare, and doesn't require any libraries beyond those in requirements.txt.

It does require SPI enabled on the Raspberry Pi.

It does not need to be run as root on Raspberry Pi OS / Raspbian, but may need to be on other distributions.
